# CDD Tooling

Reference implementation of [Contract-Driven Development](https://github.com/thegdyne/cdd) tooling.

Implements **CDD Spec 1.1.5**

## Installation

```bash
# Via pip
pip install cdd-tooling

# With PDF analysis support
pip install cdd-tooling[pdf]

# Via pipx (recommended for CLI use)
pipx install cdd-tooling[pdf]

# From source (editable)
git clone https://github.com/thegdyne/cdd-tooling.git
cd cdd-tooling
pip install -e ".[dev,pdf]"
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Analyze a reference artifact
cdd analyze reference.pdf -o analysis/baseline/

# Write contracts grounded in the analysis
# ... edit contracts/project.yaml ...

# Verify paths resolve
cdd paths contracts/

# Validate contracts
cdd lint contracts/

# Run a single contract in isolation
cdd isolate contracts/feature.yaml

# Run all tests
cdd test contracts/

# Compare output to baseline
cdd analyze output.pdf -o analysis/output/
cdd compare analysis/baseline/ analysis/output/
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `cdd spec --version` | Show spec/tool version |
| `cdd paths <contracts/>` | Verify file paths in contracts resolve |
| `cdd analyze <file> -o <dir>` | Extract baseline from PDF/HTML/source |
| `cdd compare <baseline> <output>` | Compare two analyses |
| `cdd lint <contracts/>` | Validate contract schema + coverage |
| `cdd test <contracts/>` | Run contract tests |
| `cdd isolate <contract>` | Run single contract in isolated workspace |
| `cdd coverage <contracts/>` | Requirement coverage report |

### Paths

```bash
# Verify all file paths in contracts resolve correctly
cdd paths contracts/

# Single contract
cdd paths contracts/feature.yaml

# JSON output
cdd paths contracts/ --json
```

Pre-gate check that catches path errors before running tests. Extracts paths from `files:` fields and shell command arguments, verifies they resolve relative to the contract directory.

### Analyze

```bash
# PDF analysis (requires [pdf] extra)
cdd analyze form.pdf -o analysis/

# HTML analysis
cdd analyze wireframe.html -o analysis/

# Source reference (Python, JS, SuperCollider, etc.)
cdd analyze src/gui/window.py -o analysis/baseline/

# Output varies by type:
#   PDF/HTML: structure.json, elements.md, layout.md
#   Source:   source.<ext>, structure.json, PATTERNS.md, elements.md
```

#### Source Reference Handler

For readable source files, captures a frozen snapshot for reference-based development:

```bash
cdd analyze src/existing_module.py -o analysis/baseline/
```

Creates:
```
analysis/baseline/
├── source.py          # Frozen snapshot of reference
├── structure.json     # Metadata (hash, timestamp, lines)
├── PATTERNS.md        # Pattern template (fill in)
└── elements.md        # Summary
```

**Supported types:** `.py`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.scd`, `.sc`, `.yaml`, `.json`, `.sh`, `.md`, `.css`, `.sql`, `.rs`, `.go`, `.rb`, `.lua`, `.c`, `.cpp`, `.java`, `.swift`, `.kt`

**Workflow:**
1. Analyze existing code: `cdd analyze reference.py -o analysis/baseline/`
2. Fill in `PATTERNS.md` with patterns to preserve
3. Write contract based on documented patterns
4. Implement against contract

### Compare

```bash
# Compare baseline to output (PDF, HTML, or source)
cdd compare analysis/baseline/ analysis/output/

# PDF/HTML: Shows exact deviations
#   ✗ Element spacing: baseline 15pt, output 12pt (deviation: 3pt)
#   ✓ Field dimensions: match within tolerance

# Source: Hash-based comparison
#   ✓ Files are identical
#   ✗ Files differ - use contracts to verify structural requirements

# JSON output for CI
cdd compare analysis/baseline/ analysis/output/ --json
```

### Lint

```bash
# Basic validation
cdd lint contracts/

# Strict mode (warnings become errors)
cdd lint contracts/ --strict

# JSON output for CI
cdd lint contracts/ --json
```

### Test

```bash
# Run all tests
cdd test contracts/

# With variables
cdd test contracts/ --var target=my_component

# Filter by test ID
cdd test contracts/ --only T001

# JSON output
cdd test contracts/ --json
```

### Isolate

Run a single contract in a clean, isolated workspace. Solves the problem of `cdd test` running all contracts in a directory.

```bash
# Run single contract in isolation
cdd isolate contracts/feature.yaml

# Verbose output (show setup steps)
cdd isolate contracts/feature.yaml -v

# Keep work directory after run (for debugging)
cdd isolate contracts/feature.yaml --keep

# Keep work directory only on failure
cdd isolate contracts/feature.yaml --keep-on-fail

# Preview without running (dry run)
cdd isolate contracts/feature.yaml --dry-run

# Only run path verification
cdd isolate contracts/feature.yaml --paths-only

# Custom work directory
cdd isolate contracts/feature.yaml -w /tmp/my-test
```

**How it works:**
1. Auto-detects project root (looks for `.cdd/`, `.git/`, or `src/` + `contracts/`)
2. Creates temporary workspace in `/tmp/cdd-isolate-<hash>-<pid>/`
3. Copies only the specified contract
4. Symlinks required source directories
5. Runs `cdd paths` then `cdd test`
6. Cleans up (unless `--keep`)

**Exit codes:**
| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Paths and tests passed |
| 1 | Test failure |
| 2 | Path verification failed |
| 3 | Contract parse error |
| 4 | Project root not found |
| 5 | Invalid source path |

### Coverage

```bash
# Show requirement coverage
cdd coverage contracts/

# Fail if uncovered requirements exist
cdd coverage contracts/ --strict
```

## Executors

| Executor | Status | Actions | Use Case |
|----------|--------|---------|----------|
| `python` | ✅ Full | `call`, `call_n` | Python functions |
| `shell` | ✅ Full | `shell` | CLI tools, scripts |
| `static` | ⚠️ Partial | (file assertions) | Regex/content checks |
| `sclang` | ⚠️ Stub | `render_nrt` | SuperCollider audio |

**Note:** The `sclang` executor currently returns "not_implemented". Full NRT rendering support is planned for Phase 3.

## Known Issues

| Issue | Status | Workaround |
|-------|--------|------------|
| `cdd test file.yaml` runs all contracts in directory | Fixed | Use `cdd isolate` or `--only T001` |
| Static executor `$.file.content` returns null | Open | Use shell executor with grep instead |

## Spec Compatibility

This tooling implements [CDD Spec](https://github.com/thegdyne/cdd) version **1.1.5**.

| Tooling Version | Spec Version | Status |
|-----------------|--------------|--------|
| 0.1.x | 1.1.x | Current |

The `cdd_spec` field in your contracts declares which spec version you're targeting. Tooling validates compatibility at runtime.
